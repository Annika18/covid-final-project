# covid-final-project
This is my final project for the Spring 2020 INFO 2950 class at Cornell. 

In this project,  I seek to understand what demographic factors are characteristic of communities that are particularly hard-hit by the coronavirus. 

I had to make a new repository for this project after issues with my original one at https://github.com/Annika18/info-2950. You can still see my earliest commits for the project in the original repo.
